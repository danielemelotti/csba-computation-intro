We import a dataset containing 1 variable, which is the age of a set of hypothetical customers, and move the ages into a numeric vector called _age_.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
# Loading data
dataset <- read.table("data/customers.txt", header = TRUE, colClasses = "numeric")
ages <- dataset$age
```

Then, we conduct a brief exploratory analysis; for instance, we want to determine how many customers (or ages of customers) are present within our data.

```{r}
length(ages)
```

Now we know that there are 399 customers in total. Next, we check what is the age of certain elements of the vector; for instance, the 1st, 5th and 100th element of _age_.

```{r}
ages[c(1, 5, 100)]
```

We see that the the 1st, 5th and 100th are _49_, _45_, and _34_ years old respectively.
