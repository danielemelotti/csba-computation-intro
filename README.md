# Objective
This project is the first of a series on Computational Statistics in Business Analytics (CSBA). It focuses on fundamental data exploration techniques using R, centered around a dataset of ages. The goal is to understand the distribution, central tendencies, variability, and visual representations of age data.

# Tasks
## 1. Retrieve Data Points
* Find the total number of customers contained in the dataset.
* Retrieve the age at the 1st, 5th and 100th position in the dataset.
* Retrieve the age of the youngest and oldest customer.

## 2. Sorting and High-Level Analysis
* Sort the dataset in ascending order.
* Extract the five lowest and five highest ages.
* Compute the mean of ages.
* Compute the standard deviation of ages.

## 3. Analysis of Differences
* Create a new variable, _age_diff_, representing the difference between each age and the mean age.
* Analyze the average difference between each age and the mean. Reflect on its significance in data analysis.

## 4. Visualization
